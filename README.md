# Angular Portfolio 
This project aims at building a straightforward portfolio using angular and scss. 

## Installation
1.  **Install Node.js and npm:** Angular requires Node.js and npm to be installed on your system. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/
2. **Install Angular CLI:** Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool for initializing, developing, scaffolding, and maintaining Angular applications. Install it globally using npm:
```bash 
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
3. **Create a new Angular project:** Once Angular CLI is installed, you can create a new Angular project using the ng new command. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project and run:
```bash 
ng new --no-standalone
```

> **_NOTE:_**  When prompted to add routing, select yes and then select scss as the stylesheet format to be used
```python
? Would you like to add Angular routing? Yes
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? SCSS
```
4. Navigate to the project directory: After creating the project, navigate into the project directory `cd portfolio-project-name`

5. Serve the application: 
```bash
ng serve
```
Now we can access the application at http://localhost:4200/.
